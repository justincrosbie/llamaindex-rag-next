This is a a little chatbot that uses RAG with OpenAI API via llamaindex to query your data. In Javascript! It has a little Next.JS frontend

## Getting Started

First, populate that data folders (I will upgrade to point to any url, wouldn't that be sweet)

Then, run the development server:

```bash
deno run --allow-env --allow-read --allow-net index4.js
```

Then run the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then you got yourself a pretty powerful little RAG-based chatbot that answers questions on the data!

I will be tidying this up, I swear....
